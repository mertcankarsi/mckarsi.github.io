Hi there. My name's Mertcan.

I post here about technical challenges that I faced and of course solutions. Sometimes I share things from my daily life.

My motivation to build this site is teaching is the best way to learn.

I'm a professional software developer with 8 years of experience. I have a bachelor's degree in computer systems. Nowadays I've been working for [Innova Bilişim](https://www.innova.com.tr/en) as a senior consultant. Previously I worked for [Promet Bilgi Sistemleri](https://prometbilisim.com/), [Akgün Technology](https://www.akgunyazilim.com.tr/), [Plus Telekom](http://www.plustelekom.com/).

In my career, I specialized in Java programming language. I also have a little experience with PHP and TypeScript. I am currently interested in and learning microservice architecture and want to add Go programming language to my skill set as an alternative to Java.

I play Xbox games in my spare time. If you want to join me add me (xbox: mertcankarsi)
